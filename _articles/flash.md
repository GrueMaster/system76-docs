To watch Flash videos with <u>Firefox</u>, <u>Chromium</u>, and <u>Opera</u>, we recommend using <u>Pepperflash</u>, rather than <u>Adobe Flash</u>, for security reasons.  <u>Pepperflash</u> is maintained by Google and included in the <u>Chrome</u> browser by default, and can be downloaded separately to be used in other browsers.  Please run this command to install <u>Pepperflash</u>:

```
sudo apt install browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash
```
